name: edr_test
version: "1.0"
author: Rex Steele
about: Runs several processes via Bash to imitate user actions and generate test telemetry. Network activity initiates a TCP
        connection to a target address and port, requiring a listening service to receive and complete the three-way handshake.
        File and custom processes require user have permissions to access given directory / process.
